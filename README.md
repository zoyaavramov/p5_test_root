read me is like a manual for your code/project
repositories are like buckets, where your code for something sits in
commit is something you do with your version 0 of your website, to send it out for public viewing/use
deploy is something your do with the last/finalized version of the website to send it out for public viewing/use
push is pushing your website out into the repos
pull is taking your website out of the repo its in and making changes to it
